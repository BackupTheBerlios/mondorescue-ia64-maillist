<PRE>Dear Dean,

 

Thanks for your mail.

 

Actually there are 2 rx3600 servers and I am trying on both of them. One server were able to take backup, but in the time of restore, it gives with bzip2 not found. Since its RHEL, bzip2, gzip are placed in /usr/bin, but mindi is trying on /bin/bzip2.

 

Can I copy the /usr/bin/bzip2 to /bin? Will it work ? I tried with gzip as compression option, but gzip also got into restore issue.

 

In another node, unable to take backup at all due to newt issue. Is there any solution for newt issue?

 

I have one more issue with rx7640 server, which doesn&#8217;t have vga and usb port and using MP console, unable to access keyboard. Is there any solution for accessing keyboard with MP console?

 

Thanks once again for help.

 

Regards

Ravi

Hi Ravi,

 

According to your earlier message to the list, you did get (a different system?) to create an archive, but can&#8217;t get it to restore because of the newt problem. More on that shortly.

 

This system you indicate you&#8217;re unable to create the archive.

 

I do see in your mindi.log:

WARNING - /bin/bunzip2 does not exist; cannot be LDD'd.

/bin/bzip2

WARNING - /bin/bzip2 does not exist; cannot be LDD'd.

Which you have acknowledged in your earlier post. Be sure you have bzip installed, it is a dependency.

 

But also, in your mondoarchive.log:

tar: dev/cciss/c0d0: time stamp 2011-03-27 23:31:17 is 12342 s in the future

tar: dev/cciss/c0d0p1: time stamp 2011-03-27 23:31:17 is 12342 s in the future

tar: dev/cciss/c0d0p2: time stamp 2011-03-27 23:31:17 is 12342 s in the future

.................................................Unable to handle [extra module file not found]

Everything is moving along fine until you hit that message, and then everything seems to go poorly after that. You may want to check the timestamp of that device file against your system clock, it may be that this check is causing your failure.

 

However, even if you get the archive to create, it seems there is a problem with the recovery on ia64, that you have discovered on your other system. I have seen this problem with &#8216;newt&#8217; on my systems as well. I&#8217;ve been trading messages with Bruno Cornec on this but haven&#8217;t seen any update from him lately.

 

Thanks, and good luck!

 

 

Dean Lester
